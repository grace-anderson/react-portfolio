## Description

The **React Portfolio** is a developer portfolio single-page application built using React. The app shares projects and a resume for applying for jobs. It also can be used to share work with the developer community and collaborate on projects. [Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) was used to kick start app development. [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) was used to create the routing, and [React Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) to display icons that link to developer profiles on GitHub, LinkedIn and Stack Overflow.

The app is deployed to [GitHub's GH Pages](https://grace-anderson.github.io/react-portfolio/), with the code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/grace-anderson/react-portfolio)
